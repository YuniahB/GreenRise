# Green-Rise NL — Traditional Craftsmanship, Modern City Living

**Green-Rise** develops smart, sustainable apartments inside **characterful (often monumental)** buildings in inner-city areas.  
We focus on **starting tenants (25–30)** who want vibrant neighborhoods—and quality interiors that feel like an upgrade, not a compromise.

**What makes Green-Rise different**
- **Tenant-first**: professional, service-oriented mediation; clarity from first visit to hand-over  
- **Sustainable by design**: A+ energy label, fully electric (no gas), high-performance insulation, solar readiness  
- **Quality finishes**: durable materials + modern “luxury” brands that lift everyday living  
- **Right locations**: close to cafés, shops, culture, nightlife—where young professionals actually live
