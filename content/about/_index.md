Green-Rise NL transforms characteristic (monumental) buildings into smart, sustainable inner-city apartments.



**What we believe**

\- Tenant-centric: we treat the tenant as the primary customer

\- Sustainability: A+ energy label, all-electric (no gas), solar, strong insulation

\- Quality \& style: durable materials and modern interiors (select “luxury” brands)

\- Climate ambition: toward carbon-neutral construction and operations

\- Urban living: locations near shops, restaurants, culture, nightlife



**Target group**

Starting tenants (25–30) — singles and young working couples who want to stay in vibrant city centers.



**How we work**

\- Respect the character of heritage buildings while upgrading comfort \& efficiency

\- Plan funding in phases and bridge with private equity to stay on schedule

\- Transparent communication with agencies, partners, and tenants
